  "summary": "```markdown\nThe `APIRateLimit` class is designed to manage API call execution within specified rate limits, ensuring that the number of concurrent API calls does not exceed a predefined maximum. This is particularly useful in scenarios where API providers impose rate limits, and exceeding these limits could result in throttling or temporary bans.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Concurrency Control**: Limits the number of API calls that can be executed concurrently, with a default limit of 50 concurrent calls.\n- **Queue Management**: API calls that exceed the concurrency limit are queued for later execution, ensuring no call is dropped or ignored.\n- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors gracefully during API call execution.\n\n### Usage:\n\nTo use the `APIRateLimit` class, you instantiate it, optionally specifying the maximum number of concurrent calls. Then, you use the `callApi` method to execute your API calls. This method takes a function that returns a promise (the actual API call) and manages its execution based on the current load and the rate limit.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```typescript\nconst apiLimiter = new APIRateLimit(20); // Set max concurrent calls to 20\n\nasync function fetchData() {\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(\"Data\"), 1000));\n}\n\nasync function executeCalls() {\n  const promises = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n    promises.push(apiLimiter.callApi(fetchData));\n  }\n  const results = await Promise.all(promises);\n  console.log(results);\n}\n\nexecuteCalls();\n```\n\nIn this example, `fetchData` simulates an API call. The `executeCalls` function demonstrates how to use the `APIRateLimit` class to manage executing 100 simulated API calls, ensuring that no more than 20 are running concurrently.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe `APIRateLimit` class is a powerful tool for managing API call execution within rate limits, preventing API overuse, and ensuring applications comply with provider constraints. Its implementation of queuing and concurrency control makes it an essential component in projects that rely heavily on external API calls.\n```",
  "questions": "```markdown\n### Questions and Answers:\n\n1. **What happens if `apiFunction` takes a long time to resolve?**\n   - If `apiFunction` takes a long time to resolve, it will occupy one of the `maxConcurrentCalls` slots until it completes. This means fewer slots are available for other calls, potentially slowing down the overall processing rate if many calls are long-running.\n\n2. **How does the class handle errors thrown by `apiFunction`?**\n   - Errors thrown by `apiFunction` are caught in the `catch` block of the `executeCall` function. The error is then passed to the `reject` function of the Promise returned by `callApi`, allowing the caller of `callApi` to handle the error using `.catch` or `try/catch` in an async function.\n\n3. **Is there any mechanism to prevent memory leaks in the queue?**\n   - The queue is designed to remove tasks (`executeCall` functions) as they are dequeued and executed (`this.queue.shift()`), which should prevent the queue from growing indefinitely under normal operation. However, if tasks are added at a rate faster than they can be processed, the queue could grow large, potentially leading to memory issues. The class does not explicitly include mechanisms to limit the queue size or to clear the queue under certain conditions.\n```",
