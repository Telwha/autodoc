  "summary": "```markdown\nThis code module is designed to manage a CLI (Command Line Interface) spinner, providing a visual feedback mechanism for users during operations that may take some time to complete. It utilizes the `ora` package, a popular choice for implementing spinners in Node.js applications. The spinner is configured to use a \"dots\" style, creating a simple and visually consistent loading indicator.\n\nThe module exports several functions to control the spinner's behavior:\n\n- `updateSpinnerText(message: string)`: Updates the spinner's message without stopping it. If the spinner isn't spinning, it starts the spinner with the provided message. This function is useful for providing real-time updates on the operation's progress without interrupting the visual feedback.\n\n  ```javascript\n  updateSpinnerText(\"Loading data...\");\n  ```\n\n- `stopSpinner()`: Stops the spinner if it is currently spinning. This can be used to cleanly end the spinner's animation once an operation is complete.\n\n  ```javascript\n  stopSpinner();\n  ```\n\n- `spinnerError(message?: string)`: Stops the spinner and displays an error message, indicating that the operation has failed. This is useful for providing immediate feedback on operation failure.\n\n  ```javascript\n  spinnerError(\"Failed to load data.\");\n  ```\n\n- `spinnerSuccess(message?: string)`: Similar to `spinnerError`, but indicates successful completion of an operation.\n\n  ```javascript\n  spinnerSuccess(\"Data loaded successfully.\");\n  ```\n\n- `spinnerInfo(message: string)`: Displays an informational message without stopping the spinner. This can be used for non-critical updates that don't necessarily indicate completion or failure.\n\n  ```javascript\n  spinnerInfo(\"Please wait...\");\n  ```\n\nOverall, this module serves as a utility for enhancing user experience in CLI applications by providing dynamic feedback during operations that might otherwise leave the user wondering about the status of the process. It's a crucial component for improving the interactivity and professionalism of CLI tools.\n```",
  "questions": "```markdown\n### Questions and Answers:\n\n1. **What is the purpose of checking `spinner.isSpinning` before updating the spinner's state?**\n\n   The check ensures that the spinner's state is only modified (e.g., updated, stopped, or marked as failed/succeeded) if it is currently active (spinning). This prevents potential errors or unexpected behavior by trying to update or stop a spinner that isn't running.\n\n2. **Why does `spinnerError`, `spinnerSuccess`, and `spinnerInfo` have different parameter requirements (`message` being optional in the first two and required in the last)?**\n\n   This design choice allows `spinnerError` and `spinnerSuccess` to be called without a message, defaulting to a generic failure or success indicator. In contrast, `spinnerInfo` requires a specific message, implying that informational updates are expected to provide context or details, thus necessitating a message.\n\n3. **Is there a reason for not having a `spinner.warn` method, similar to `spinner.info`, `spinner.fail`, and `spinner.succeed`?**\n\n   The absence of a `spinner.warn` method might be due to the original design scope of the `ora` package or the specific requirements of the `autodoc` project, which did not necessitate a distinct warning state. However, if warnings are a common use case, it might be worth considering adding such a method for consistency and clarity.\n```",
