      "summary": "```markdown\nThe provided code snippet is designed to facilitate the creation of an AI-powered documentation assistant within the `autodoc` project. This assistant leverages language models (like GPT-3 or GPT-4) to generate conversational answers to questions about a specific software project, incorporating technical content and providing hyperlinks back to GitHub for reference.\n\n### High-Level Purpose\n\nThe core functionality revolves around generating context-aware, detailed answers to user queries about a project's documentation. It does so by:\n\n1. **Condensing Follow-Up Questions**: Transforming follow-up questions into standalone questions that can be understood without prior context.\n2. **Creating Detailed Answers**: Generating answers that are tailored to the project's documentation, including examples and GitHub links, aimed at a specific target audience.\n\n### Components\n\n- **Prompt Templates**: Utilizes `PromptTemplate` to create structured prompts that guide the AI in generating responses. These templates ensure that the AI's output is relevant, concise, and within the specified word limit.\n- **Language Model Chains**: Implements `LLMChain` and `ChatVectorDBQAChain` to process the input through various stages, including question condensation and answer generation, leveraging vector databases for efficient information retrieval.\n- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Chooses between available language models (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4) based on availability, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in processing.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nConsider a scenario where a user asks a question about a project named \"AutoDoc\". The system would:\n\n1. Use the `makeQAPrompt` function to prepare a detailed prompt including the project name, repository URL, content type, additional instructions, and the user's question.\n2. The `makeChain` function orchestrates the process, selecting the appropriate language model, generating a standalone question, and then producing a detailed, markdown-formatted answer that adheres to the constraints (e.g., word limit, relevance).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code is integral to building an AI assistant that can provide informative, context-aware, and conversational documentation support for software projects. It exemplifies the use of advanced AI techniques to enhance the accessibility and understanding of complex technical documentation.\n\n```\n",
      "questions": "```markdown\n1. **What is the purpose of the `CONDENSE_PROMPT` and how is it used within the code?**\n   The `CONDENSE_PROMPT` is designed to rephrase follow-up questions into standalone questions based on a given chat history. It is used by the `questionGenerator` instance of `LLMChain` to generate questions that can be understood without needing the context of the previous conversation.\n\n2. **How does the `makeChain` function decide which language model (GPT-4 or GPT-3) to use?**\n   The `makeChain` function selects the language model based on the availability within the `llms` array. It attempts to use the second model in the array (`llms[1]`) as the default choice; if not available, it falls back to the first model (`llms[0]`).\n\n3. **What is the role of the `vectorstore` parameter in the `makeChain` function?**\n   The `vectorstore` parameter, which is expected to be an instance of `HNSWLib`, is used by the `ChatVectorDBQAChain` to store and retrieve vector representations of documents or chat history. This facilitates efficient searching and matching of relevant documents or Q&A pairs based on the input question.\n```",

      "summary": "```markdown\nThe provided code snippet is designed to facilitate an interactive chatbot interface for the `autodoc` project, which aims to assist users by answering questions related to a specific codebase. This chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to understand and respond to user queries in a meaningful way.\n\n### Key Components and Their Roles:\n\n- **chalk & marked-terminal**: These libraries are used for styling and formatting the output in the terminal, making the interaction more user-friendly and visually appealing.\n- **inquirer**: Facilitates collecting input from the user through the command line.\n- **marked**: Converts Markdown text to terminal-friendly output, allowing the chatbot to display responses that may include code snippets or other Markdown-formatted content.\n- **langchain/embeddings & hnswlib.js**: These components are crucial for understanding and processing the natural language queries. They likely work by converting text into numerical vectors and using these for efficient similarity search or question answering tasks.\n- **AutodocRepoConfig & AutodocUserConfig**: Configuration objects that store settings and preferences for the repository and the user, respectively. These configurations are used to tailor the chatbot's behavior and responses.\n\n### Workflow:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The chatbot initializes by loading necessary configurations and setting up the NLP model for processing queries.\n2. **Welcome Message**: A welcome message is displayed to the user, indicating the chatbot is ready to receive queries.\n3. **Query Processing Loop**:\n   - The user is prompted to enter a question.\n   - The question is processed by the chatbot, which involves understanding the query, searching for relevant information, and generating a response.\n   - The response is formatted as Markdown and displayed to the user.\n   - This loop continues until the user types 'exit'.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming the `query` function is exposed and can be called with appropriate configurations\nconst repoConfig = { name: \"MyProject\", repositoryUrl: \"https://github.com/myproject\", output: \"./output\", contentType: \"code\", chatPrompt: \"How can I assist?\", targetAudience: \"developers\" };\nconst userConfig = { llms: true };\n\nquery(repoConfig, userConfig).then(() => {\n  console.log(\"Chatbot session ended.\");\n});\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a powerful tool for developers and users seeking assistance with a specific codebase, leveraging modern NLP techniques to provide real-time, context-aware support directly from the terminal.\n```",
      "questions": "```markdown\n### Questions and Answers:\n\n1. **What is the purpose of the `chatHistory` array and how is it used within the `query` function?**\n\n   The `chatHistory` array is used to store pairs of questions and answers to maintain a context for the conversation. It is passed to the `chain.call` method to potentially influence the generation of responses based on previous interactions.\n\n2. **How does the `AutodocRepoConfig` and `AutodocUserConfig` configurations affect the behavior of the `query` function?**\n\n   The `AutodocRepoConfig` and `AutodocUserConfig` provide necessary parameters such as project name, repository URL, documentation output path, content type, chat prompt, target audience, and language learning models (llms) to tailor the chatbot's responses and data handling to the specific needs of the project and user preferences.\n\n3. **What is the role of the `marked` library and the `TerminalRenderer` in this code?**\n\n   The `marked` library, configured with the `TerminalRenderer`, is used to convert markdown text into a format suitable for display in the terminal. This allows the chatbot to output responses in a visually appealing and readable format directly in the command line.\n```",
