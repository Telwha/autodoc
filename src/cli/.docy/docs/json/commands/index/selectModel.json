  "summary": "```markdown\nThe `selectModel` function is designed to select the most appropriate language model for a given task based on the input prompts, available models, and a specified priority (either cost or another factor not specified here). This function is part of a larger system that likely involves processing natural language inputs and requires choosing among different versions of language models, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and a variant of GPT-4 referred to as GPT432k.\n\n### High-Level Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of this code is to automate the selection of a language model that best fits the requirements of a task, considering the length of the input prompts and the priority (e.g., minimizing cost). This is crucial in applications where the cost of using more powerful models needs to be balanced with the need for processing longer inputs or achieving higher quality outputs.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Priority Handling**: The function first checks the priority. If the priority is set to `COST`, it tries to select the model in the order of GPT-3, GPT-4, and GPT432k, based on whether the model can handle the maximum length of the provided prompts.\n   \n2. **Model Selection Based on Length**: If the priority is not `COST`, it defaults to selecting GPT-4 unless GPT-4 cannot handle the prompt lengths, in which case it checks GPT432k. If neither is suitable, it defaults to a model referred to as `GPT4turbo`.\n\n3. **Encoding and Length Calculation**: A helper function, `getMaxPromptLength`, is used to determine the maximum length of the encoded prompts for a specific model. This involves encoding each prompt using a model-specific encoding function (`encoding_for_model`) and finding the prompt with the maximum length.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst prompts = [\"Hello, world!\", \"This is a test prompt.\"];\nconst availableModels = [LLMModels.GPT3, LLMModels.GPT4];\nconst modelsDetails = {\n  [LLMModels.GPT3]: { maxLength: 100 },\n  [LLMModels.GPT4]: { maxLength: 200 },\n};\nconst selectedModel = selectModel(prompts, availableModels, modelsDetails, Priority.COST);\n\nconsole.log(selectedModel); // Outputs details for the GPT-4 model if it can handle the prompts' length.\n```\n\nThis function is particularly useful in scenarios where dynamically selecting the most cost-effective or capable language model is necessary for processing varying lengths of input prompts, optimizing for either performance or cost.\n```",
  "questions": "```markdown\n### Questions and Answers:\n\n1. **What is the purpose of the `encoding_for_model` function?**\n\n   The `encoding_for_model` function likely converts prompts into a model-specific encoding format. This is important for calculating the maximum length of prompts after encoding, which is necessary for selecting the appropriate model based on its maximum supported input length.\n\n2. **How does the function `selectModel` decide which model to return?**\n\n   The `selectModel` function selects a model based on the priority (cost or another factor not specified in the code snippet) and the models' ability to handle the maximum length of the encoded prompts. It checks if the models are included in the `llms` array and if their `maxLength` property can accommodate the encoded prompts' length, returning the first model that meets these criteria or `null` if none do.\n\n3. **What happens if `Priority` is not `COST` and `LLMModels.GPT4` is not included in `llms`?**\n\n   If the priority is not `COST` and `LLMModels.GPT4` is not included in the `llms` array, the function defaults to returning `models[LLMModels.GPT4turbo]`, assuming it is a fallback model. This implies that `GPT4turbo` is considered a suitable default regardless of the prompts' length or other models' availability.\n```",
