  "summary": "```markdown\nThe `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is a key component of a documentation generation tool, designed to automate the conversion of JSON-based documentation into Markdown files. This function is particularly useful for projects that maintain their documentation or metadata in JSON format and wish to present it in a more human-readable form, such as GitHub repositories.\n\n### High-Level Purpose\n\nThe primary goal of this function is to traverse a project's file system, identify JSON files containing documentation or metadata, and convert these files into Markdown format. This process involves reading the content of each JSON file, parsing it according to predefined structures (`FolderSummary`, `FileSummary`, `FolderSummaryMermaid`, `FileSummaryMermaid`), and generating Markdown (or Mermaid diagrams for visual representation) files that summarize the content in a more accessible manner.\n\n### Usage in Larger Project\n\nIn the broader scope of the project, `convertJsonToMarkdown` serves as a bridge between raw, structured data and user-friendly documentation. It automates the tedious task of manually converting JSON files into Markdown, thus streamlining the documentation process for developers. This function can be particularly beneficial in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, where documentation needs to be updated frequently to reflect changes in the codebase.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```javascript\n// Configuration for documentation generation\nconst config = {\n  name: \"MyProject\",\n  root: \"./src\",\n  output: \"./docs\",\n  filePromptMermaid: false,\n  folderPromptMermaid: false,\n  filePrompt: true,\n  folderPrompt: true,\n  contentType: \"code\",\n  targetAudience: \"developers\",\n  linkHosted: \"https://github.com/myproject\",\n};\n\n// Convert JSON documentation to Markdown\nconvertJsonToMarkdown(config).then(() => {\n  console.log(\"Documentation has been successfully generated!\");\n});\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to configure and invoke the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function to generate Markdown documentation from JSON files located in the `./src` directory and output the generated files to the `./docs` directory.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is a powerful tool for automating the generation of readable documentation from JSON files. By integrating this function into a project, developers can significantly reduce the effort required to maintain up-to-date documentation, allowing them to focus more on development tasks.\n```\n",
  "questions": "```markdown\n### Questions and Answers:\n\n1. **What is the purpose of the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function?**\n\n   The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function aims to convert JSON files from a project into markdown files, potentially including mermaid diagrams, based on the configuration provided. It counts the number of files in the project and creates markdown (and possibly mermaid) files for each, organizing them according to the project's structure.\n\n2. **How does the function handle errors during file reading or writing?**\n\n   The function includes basic error handling with `try-catch` blocks around file system operations like reading files, creating directories, and writing files. However, it only logs errors to the console and returns early from the current operation without further error management or retry logic.\n\n3. **What is the significance of checking if `inputRoot` includes 'mermaid'?**\n\n   The check for 'mermaid' in `inputRoot` determines the processing path for the content: if 'mermaid' is included, it processes the content as a mermaid diagram (using `FolderSummaryMermaid` or `FileSummaryMermaid` types); otherwise, it processes the content as a standard markdown file (using `FolderSummary` or `FileSummary` types). This implies that the presence of 'mermaid' in the input path triggers a different content generation strategy.\n```",
