The provided code from the `autodoc` project consists of functions designed to generate documentation prompts and summaries for code files and folders within a software project. These functions are crucial for automating the creation of documentation, making it easier for developers and documentation experts to generate consistent, structured descriptions and questions about the project's contents. This automation can significantly enhance the documentation process, ensuring thorough and uniform documentation across the project.

### Functions Overview

- `createCodeFileSummary`: Generates a prompt for documenting a specific code file. It includes the file's path, project name, contents, content type (e.g., code, documentation), and a custom prompt. This function is useful for creating detailed documentation for individual files, guiding the documentation expert on how to approach the file's content.

  **Example Usage:**
  ```javascript
  const fileSummary = createCodeFileSummary('/src/index.js', 'MyProject', 'console.log("Hello, world!");', 'JavaScript code', 'Write a detailed technical explanation of what this code does.');
  ```

- `createCodeQuestions`: Creates a prompt asking for questions a specific audience might have about a file's content. This is particularly useful for creating FAQ sections or ensuring that documentation addresses potential user concerns or confusion points.

  **Example Usage:**
  ```javascript
  const questions = createCodeQuestions('/src/index.js', 'MyProject', 'console.log("Hello, world!");', 'JavaScript code', 'beginner programmers');
  ```

- `mermaidFolderSummaryPrompt` and `folderSummaryPrompt`: These functions generate prompts for documenting a folder within the project, including summaries of its files and subfolders. The `mermaidFolderSummaryPrompt` is tailored for creating documentation that includes mermaid markdown code, which is useful for visual representations of folder structures or file relationships.

  **Example Usage:**
  ```javascript
  const folderSummary = folderSummaryPrompt('/src', 'MyProject', [{fileName: 'index.js', summary: 'Entry point of the application.'}], [{folderName: 'utils', summary: 'Utility functions.'}], 'Folder documentation', 'Provide an overview of the folder contents.');
  ```

### High-Level Purpose

The primary purpose of these functions is to streamline the documentation process within software projects. By providing structured prompts and summaries, the `autodoc` project aims to make it easier for documentation experts to create consistent, comprehensive, and useful documentation. This not only benefits the developers and maintainers of the project by saving time and effort but also enhances the experience for end-users by providing clear, accessible documentation.

## Questions: 
 ```markdown
### Questions and Answers:

1. **What is the purpose of the `contentType` parameter in these functions?**

   The `contentType` parameter specifies the type of content being documented (e.g., code, design, documentation). It allows the functions to be reused for different types of content by dynamically inserting the content type into the generated documentation text.

2. **How are `FileSummary` and `FolderSummary` types used in the `mermaidFolderSummaryPrompt` and `folderSummaryPrompt` functions?**

   `FileSummary` and `FolderSummary` are used to represent the summary information of files and folders, respectively. In both `mermaidFolderSummaryPrompt` and `folderSummaryPrompt` functions, they are iterated over to construct a detailed summary of each file and folder within a given folder path, including their names and summaries.

3. **Why do the functions return a template literal with instructions and placeholders instead of directly generating documentation?**

   The functions return template literals with placeholders to provide a structured and consistent format for documentation prompts. This approach allows developers or documentation experts to fill in specific details or answer prompts based on the provided structure, ensuring that the documentation is both comprehensive and tailored to the project's needs.
