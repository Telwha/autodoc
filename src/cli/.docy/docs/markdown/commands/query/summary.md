The code within the `.docy/docs/json/commands/query` folder is designed to enhance the `autodoc` project by providing an AI-powered documentation assistant and an interactive chatbot interface. These components work together to offer users conversational and context-aware support for navigating and understanding a specific codebase. The assistant and chatbot leverage advanced NLP and ML techniques, including language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4, to generate detailed, informative responses to user queries.

### AI-Powered Documentation Assistant

The `createChatChain.ts` file outlines the creation of an AI documentation assistant. This assistant is capable of generating conversational answers to technical questions, effectively condensing follow-up questions and creating detailed answers that include examples and GitHub links. It utilizes `PromptTemplate` for structured prompts and `LLMChain` along with `ChatVectorDBQAChain` for processing input through various stages. This ensures that the assistant can dynamically select the most suitable language model based on availability, providing flexibility in generating responses.

### Interactive Chatbot Interface

The `index.ts` file facilitates an interactive chatbot interface, employing libraries such as `chalk`, `marked-terminal`, `inquirer`, and `marked` for styling, formatting, and collecting user input. It also uses `langchain/embeddings` and `hnswlib.js` for processing natural language queries. The chatbot is configured to understand user queries, search for relevant information, and generate Markdown-formatted responses, making the interaction user-friendly and visually appealing.

### Integration and Usage

These components can be integrated into the larger `autodoc` project to provide a comprehensive support system for users seeking assistance with a specific codebase. The AI-powered documentation assistant can generate detailed technical responses, while the interactive chatbot interface offers a more engaging way to interact with the documentation.

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
// Using the AI-powered documentation assistant
const detailedAnswer = createChatChain("How do I implement feature X in Project Y?");
console.log(detailedAnswer);

// Interacting with the chatbot interface
const repoConfig = { name: "MyProject", repositoryUrl: "https://github.com/myproject" };
const userConfig = { llms: true };
query(repoConfig, userConfig).then(() => {
  console.log("Chatbot session ended.");
});
```

These tools are essential for developers and users who require real-time, detailed, and context-aware assistance with navigating and understanding complex codebases, enhancing the overall accessibility and usability of technical documentation.
