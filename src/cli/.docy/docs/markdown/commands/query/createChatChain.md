```markdown
The provided code snippet is designed to facilitate the creation of an AI-powered documentation assistant within the `autodoc` project. This assistant leverages language models (like GPT-3 or GPT-4) to generate conversational answers to questions about a specific software project, incorporating technical content and providing hyperlinks back to GitHub for reference.

### High-Level Purpose

The core functionality revolves around generating context-aware, detailed answers to user queries about a project's documentation. It does so by:

1. **Condensing Follow-Up Questions**: Transforming follow-up questions into standalone questions that can be understood without prior context.
2. **Creating Detailed Answers**: Generating answers that are tailored to the project's documentation, including examples and GitHub links, aimed at a specific target audience.

### Components

- **Prompt Templates**: Utilizes `PromptTemplate` to create structured prompts that guide the AI in generating responses. These templates ensure that the AI's output is relevant, concise, and within the specified word limit.
- **Language Model Chains**: Implements `LLMChain` and `ChatVectorDBQAChain` to process the input through various stages, including question condensation and answer generation, leveraging vector databases for efficient information retrieval.
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Chooses between available language models (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4) based on availability, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in processing.

### Usage Example

Consider a scenario where a user asks a question about a project named "AutoDoc". The system would:

1. Use the `makeQAPrompt` function to prepare a detailed prompt including the project name, repository URL, content type, additional instructions, and the user's question.
2. The `makeChain` function orchestrates the process, selecting the appropriate language model, generating a standalone question, and then producing a detailed, markdown-formatted answer that adheres to the constraints (e.g., word limit, relevance).

### Conclusion

This code is integral to building an AI assistant that can provide informative, context-aware, and conversational documentation support for software projects. It exemplifies the use of advanced AI techniques to enhance the accessibility and understanding of complex technical documentation.

## Questions: 
 ```markdown
1. **What is the purpose of the `CONDENSE_PROMPT` and how is it used within the code?**
   The `CONDENSE_PROMPT` is designed to rephrase follow-up questions into standalone questions based on a given chat history. It is used by the `questionGenerator` instance of `LLMChain` to generate questions that can be understood without needing the context of the previous conversation.

2. **How does the `makeChain` function decide which language model (GPT-4 or GPT-3) to use?**
   The `makeChain` function selects the language model based on the availability within the `llms` array. It attempts to use the second model in the array (`llms[1]`) as the default choice; if not available, it falls back to the first model (`llms[0]`).

3. **What is the role of the `vectorstore` parameter in the `makeChain` function?**
   The `vectorstore` parameter, which is expected to be an instance of `HNSWLib`, is used by the `ChatVectorDBQAChain` to store and retrieve vector representations of documents or chat history. This facilitates efficient searching and matching of relevant documents or Q&A pairs based on the input question.
