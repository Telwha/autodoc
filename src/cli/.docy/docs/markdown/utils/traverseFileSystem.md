```markdown
The `traverseFileSystem` function, part of a larger documentation automation tool, is designed to recursively traverse through a file system starting from a specified input path. Its primary purpose is to process files and folders according to user-defined criteria, making it a versatile tool for generating documentation or performing file system operations based on the content and structure of files and directories.

### High-Level Overview

The function accepts a `params` object containing various parameters such as `inputPath`, `projectName`, and functions like `processFile` and `processFolder` for custom processing of files and folders. It also includes patterns to ignore (`ignore`), prompts, content type, target audience, and a link to hosted documentation if applicable.

Upon invocation, it first checks if the input path exists. Then, it uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to recursively visit each directory and file in the path, excluding those matching the ignore patterns. For each folder, it calls `processFolder` (if provided), and for each file that is determined to be a text file, it calls `processFile` (if provided).

### Usage Example

Consider a scenario where you want to generate documentation for all JavaScript files in a project, excluding the `node_modules` directory:

```javascript
traverseFileSystem({
  inputPath: './myProject',
  projectName: 'My Awesome Project',
  ignore: ['node_modules/**'],
  processFile: async ({ fileName, filePath }) => {
    if (fileName.endsWith('.js')) {
      // Generate documentation for JavaScript file
    }
  },
  processFolder: async ({ folderName, folderPath }) => {
    // Optional: Perform operations on folders, e.g., generate an index
  },
  // Additional parameters...
});
```

### Conclusion

The `traverseFileSystem` function is a powerful utility within the autodoc project, enabling automated, customizable processing of files and folders for documentation purposes. Its design allows for flexible integration into various workflows, supporting a wide range of documentation generation and file system manipulation tasks.

## Questions:

### Questions and Answers:

1. **What is the purpose of the `ignore` parameter in the `traverseFileSystem` function?**

   The `ignore` parameter is used to specify patterns for files or directories that should be skipped during the traversal. It utilizes the `minimatch` library to match file names against the provided patterns, allowing users to exclude certain files or directories from processing.

2. **How does the `processFile` and `processFolder` functionality work within the traversal process?**

   Both `processFile` and `processFolder` are optional callback functions that are invoked when a file or folder is encountered during the traversal, respectively. These callbacks allow for custom processing of each file or folder, such as generating documentation or performing analysis. The specific parameters passed to these callbacks provide context about the current file or folder being processed, including its path, name, and other relevant information.

3. **What happens if the `inputPath` does not exist or is inaccessible?**

   If the `inputPath` provided to the `traverseFileSystem` function does not exist or is inaccessible, the function attempts to access it using `fs.access`. If this access check fails, an error message is logged to the console indicating that the provided folder path does not exist, and the function returns early without performing any traversal. This prevents the function from proceeding with an invalid path and potentially causing further errors.
