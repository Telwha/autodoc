```markdown
The provided code snippet from the `autodoc` project includes two asynchronous utility functions designed to handle specific timing and polling scenarios, potentially useful in a variety of applications including testing, synchronization tasks, or delayed operations.

### Function: `wait`

The `wait` function is a simple utility that returns a `Promise` which resolves after a specified timeout. This can be used to introduce a delay in the execution flow. The function accepts two parameters: `timeoutMs`, which specifies the delay in milliseconds, and an optional `value` parameter that the promise resolves with.

#### Usage Example:

```javascript
await wait(1000); // Waits for 1 second
console.log("1 second passed");
```

### Function: `forTrue`

The `forTrue` function is designed for polling a condition until it becomes true. It accepts a function `fn` that should return a boolean value. The function repeatedly checks the condition every 50 milliseconds. If the condition becomes true, it resolves the promise. If the condition does not become true within 200 attempts (approximately 10 seconds), it rejects the promise. This can be particularly useful for waiting on certain conditions to be met before proceeding with the execution of subsequent code.

#### Usage Example:

```javascript
await forTrue(() => document.readyState === "complete");
console.log("Document is fully loaded");
```

In summary, these functions provide mechanisms for delaying execution and polling for conditions, which can be integral in scenarios where timing and asynchronous checks are crucial. They encapsulate complex logic of managing timers and intervals into simple, reusable, and readable abstractions, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the larger `autodoc` project.

## Questions: 
 ```markdown
### Questions and Answers:

1. **What is the purpose of the `wait` function, and how should it be used?**

   The `wait` function is designed to return a promise that resolves after a specified timeout, optionally returning a value. It can be used to introduce a delay in asynchronous operations.

2. **Why does the `forTrue` function not increment the `count` variable, and how does this affect its functionality?**

   The `count` variable is initialized but never incremented within the `forTrue` function. This oversight means the function's attempt to reject the promise after 200 attempts (or checks) will never occur, potentially leading to an infinite loop if the condition never becomes true.

3. **What happens if the `fn` function passed to `forTrue` never returns `true`?**

   If the `fn` function never returns `true`, and given the current implementation flaw where `count` is not incremented, the `forTrue` function will create an infinite loop that continuously checks the condition every 50 milliseconds without ever rejecting the promise.
